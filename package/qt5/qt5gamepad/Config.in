	  Qt Gamepad is an add-on library that enables Qt applications to support the use of gamepad hardware and in some cases remote control equipment. 
	  The module provides both QML and C++ interfaces. The primary target audience are embedded devices with fullscreen user interfaces, and mobile applications 
	  targeting TV-like form factors.
